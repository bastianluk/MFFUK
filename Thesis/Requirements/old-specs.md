## Zásady pro vypracování

IVIS is a web-based data processing and visualization framework that provides components to setup highly customized visualization. IVIS relies on Node.js on the server side and the ReactJS and D3.js libraries on the client side. While IVIS has some basic component for visualizing time-series data, predominantly in the form of a line-chart, it lacks visualization components for deeper analytics insights such as correlations among data (e.g. scatter plot, histograms, etc.)

The goal of this thesis is to implement components for statistical graphs, mainly focusing on correlation of two or more variables. In particular, the thesis will provide components for histogram, scatterplot, and heatmap (histogram of two variables). These components will be connected to existing parts of the framework. Special emphasis will be given to interactivity of the plots.
